Note: A MacOS computer is needed to run on iOS
1. Open Xcode and Your Project

    Launch Xcode from your Applications folder.
    Open your project by going to File > Open and selecting your .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace file (whichever is available—use .xcworkspace if your project uses CocoaPods).

2. Select a Target Device

    Look at the toolbar at the top of Xcode, and you'll see a dropdown menu next to the Run button (a play icon).
    Click the device dropdown menu and select your target device (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro, iPad, etc.). If you want to test on a physical iOS device, connect it to your Mac, and it should appear in the list.

3. Check Signing and Capabilities

    Select your project in the Project Navigator (left sidebar), then click on your project name at the top of the central editor window.
    Under Targets, select the main app target (often named after your project).
    In the Signing & Capabilities tab, select a valid Apple Developer account under Team. If you’re just testing on a physical device and don't need full distribution capabilities, an Apple ID account is enough.

4. Build the Project
    Click the Play button to start running. Make sure your iPhone is plugged in.
